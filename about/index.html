      I am a 5th year architecture student at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago.
      After I finished high school in Morocco I moved to Barcelona where I did my 3 first
      years of architecture school at ETSAB Escola TÃ©cnica Superior D'Arquitectura de Barcelona.
      Then I transferred in 2013 to Chicago. I have always been interested in the application of
      new technologies to architecture as a way to show the audience the ideas that I have and the
      spaces that I design. I have done it through videos for the last 6 years, and I am currently
      exploring other technologies as VR and projection mapping.
      Expected graduation date May 14th 2016.
